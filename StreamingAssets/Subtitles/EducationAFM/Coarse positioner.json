	"subtitle":"The coarse positioning engagement system is composed of a three-axis linear dovetail stage and a stepping motor. The dovetail stage allows manual in-plane movement to align the probe to the area of interest on the sample. A stepper motor is used to control the out-of-plane motion of the dovetail stage to allow programmatically controlled probe sample engagement."
