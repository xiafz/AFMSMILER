	"subtitle":"The Wheatstone Bridge amplifier is a driver electronics that amplifies the piezoresistive element output signal. Voltage amplifiers are used to convert resistance measurement into a voltage signal proportional to the cantilever deflection. A buffer circuit is also available to amplify the drive voltage and provide sufficient current to the electrothermal heater for resonance excitation."
