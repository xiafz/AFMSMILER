	"subtitle":"Interferometry is a laser-based technique for high-precision displacement measurement. Both fiber-based and free-space interferometry have been developed. In a typical fiber-based interferometry sensing scheme, a cleaved fiber is placed in close proximity to the cantilever within a range of tens of microns. The intensity of the reflected laser with wavelength from the fiber-air interface and the cantilever back are used to form a Michelson interferometer to generate a photodiode voltage output. In a free-space configuration, a reference mirror replaces the laser from the fiber-air interface during interference."
