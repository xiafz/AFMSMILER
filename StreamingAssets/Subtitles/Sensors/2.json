	"subtitle":"Astigmatic detection is widely used in CD/DVD drives to detect digital data bits. It operates by using an astigmatic lens with different focal distance in the horizontal and vertical directions. For cantilever deflection sensing, the horizontal and vertical components of the reflected laser would have different focus that can be detected by the quadrature photodiode."
