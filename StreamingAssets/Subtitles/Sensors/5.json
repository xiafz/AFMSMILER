	"subtitle":"Piezoelectric effect is the generation of electric charge due to externally applied mechanical stress. By covering the cantilever with a layer of piezoelectric material, the charge generated is linearly proportional to the cantilever deflection. This charge can be read with an external amplifier to measure the cantilever deflection. Due to the charge leakage problem, only dynamic oscillatory signal can be measured using this method since charge generated by static deflection will gradually leaks out."
