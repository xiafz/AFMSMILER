	"subtitle":"Piezoresistive element is an embedded deflection sensing technique. It is a relatively matured embedded sensing methods offering subnanometer resolution comparable to the standard OBD sensors. Four piezoresistors are placed at the surface of the cantilever base to form a Wheatstone bridge that measures the internal longitudinal stress, which is linearly proportional to the deflection. Both static and dynamic signals can be measured with piezoresisitive sensors."
