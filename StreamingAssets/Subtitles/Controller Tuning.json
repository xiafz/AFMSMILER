	"subtitle":"The controller tuning module is designed to simulate the AFM imaging controller tuning process in contact mode with constant force.  The PID controller aims to track the AFM sample topography by maintaining a constant cantilever deflection. For manual tuning of the AFM controller, a common practice is to adjust controller parameters to match the trace and retrace lines. The effect of system parameter adjustments on scan line change can be directly visualized in this simulator, where the cantilever and the sample are both modeled as a set of mass-spring-damper system. To run a controller tuning virtual experiment, use the following steps. 1.To create a sample with varying topography, click on Draw and select the vertices on the main screen area. Notice that undercut geometries cannot be imaged and is therefore forbidden by the system. Alternatively, save/load 2D line topography data into the system. 2.Input the sample and cantilever stiffness, damping properties, the desired cantilever deflection to be tracked, in-plane scan speed and the PID parameters. System preset values can also be utilized to evaluate various cases. 3.Click the Scan button to run the simulation and see the trace and retrace visualized on the screen. The difference between the measured topography and the true topography is also shown as an indicator of the tracking performance. 4.Adjust the PID controller parameters and rerun the simulation to observe their effect. Optimize the parameters based on typical PID tuning strategies and get familiarized with the AFM imaging parameter tuning process. Use this module as a practice before conducting real AFM imaging is highly recommended."
