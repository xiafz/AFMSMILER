	"subtitle":"The hardware interaction module is designed to interface with the low-cost educational AFM and the macroscopic AFM modified from a 3D printer. Running this module requires connection to external hardware for data exchange through serial communication so only the PC version can run this module. In principle, any AFM system can be utilized as long as the communication protocol used in the documentation is followed. To run an imaging experiment, use the following steps. 1.Connect to the hardware via USB cable to the PC. Select the appropriate serial port parameters in the software and click on the Connect button. 2.Make sure the sample is properly installed and click the Zero button to wait for the system to establish a global zero position. 3.	Enter the desired imaging parameters for range, pixel resolution and scan rate. 4.Click the Start button and watch the pixels being acquired by the system. To stop the experiment, click the Stop button. Save the acquired data in the Unity software or on the AFM hardware directly."
