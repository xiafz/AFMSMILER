	"subtitle":"Chemical Force Microscopy uses chemical interactions between the probe and the sample to determine the chemical nature of the surface being imaged. The interaction between various chemical components can be non-linear in nature and the probe can be operated in any combination of dynamics including contact, tapping, multi-frequency, jumping modes. Depending on the target property to be measured, these modes can be mixed and matched during the experiments, making it a hybrid AFM imaging mode."
