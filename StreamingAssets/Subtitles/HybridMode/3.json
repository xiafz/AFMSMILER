	"subtitle":"AFM-based infrared spectroscopy is a complex hybrid mode that combines contact and tapping modes. This technique aims to characterize the photothermal absorption of the material by combining a laser source and the AFM. AFM-IR have two primary flavors including contact-mode photo-thermal induced resonance and non-contact Photo-induced Force Microscopy. A revised version for PTIR utilizes a pulsed laser at the resonance of the cantilever as resonance enhanced PTIR, which can be operated either in contact-resonance mode or tapping mode. The animation illustrates the basic version of contact-mode PTIR without modulation. For Photo-induced Force Microscopy operation, the AFM cantilever piezo resonance excitation frequency and the laser pulse frequency can either operate both at the first cantilever resonance or causing deflection oscillation at both first and second resonance in a so-called sideband bimodal detection mode, which is to some extent similar to multifrequency operation. As a result, AFM-IR can be viewed as a complex hybrid mode between contact and dynamic modes."
