	"subtitle":"SThM is a contact mode AFM technique that focuses on the temperature and thermal conductivity of a sample. SThM works by utilizing specialized probes such as Thermocouple probes or bolometer probes. Thermocouple probes monitor the probe temperature by a thermocouple junction at the tip. Bolometer probes monitor probe temperature by a thin-film resistor at the tip. In the bolometer probe, the fractional change in probe resistance from an applied local heater is used to analyze the temperature of the sample. This method can also be used to find the thermal conductance of the sample. As the tip makes contact with the sample, a thermal conductivity map can be created if the heat flow of the tip and the sample can be detected with known temperature gradient. As shown in the animation, a temperature or a thermal conductivity trace is created at each pixel location in addition to the topography."
