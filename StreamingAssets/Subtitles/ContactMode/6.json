	"subtitle":"Scanning Spreading Resistance Microscopy is a contact mode AFM similar to scanning voltage and conductive AFM. In this case, the spreading resistance with respect to the conductive probe tip contact point on the sample is measured typically for semiconductor devices. As shown in the animation, a resistance trace is created at each pixel location. Due to the presence of oxidation or contamination layers on the surface, SSMR typically uses a diamond tip with high tip-sample interaction force to cut through the layers and directly measures the sample."
