	"subtitle":"Scanning Microwave Microscopy is a form of Contact mode AFM that uses microwaves to determine the local sample electrical such as the dielectric constant and the dopant density. In addition to a conductive AFM probe brought into contact with the sample, additional components including a radio frequency wave source, a low loss coaxial cable and a receiver are needed during image formation as shown in the animation. The radio frequency wave source as well as the receiver operate on the same frequency, typically a few GHz. The SMM works by sending a radio frequency electrical signal from the source and evaluate the transmitted and reflected radio signal to determine the complex impedance at each point with spatial resolution much higher than the wavelength. With a superimposed low-frequency modulation signal, the capacitance from carrier depletion in semiconductor samples can also be evaluated."
