	"subtitle":"Constant height contact mode is the most fundamental AFM imaging technique. This mode does not require any position feedback on the out-of-plane direction. During scanning, the relative height between the AFM cantilever and the sample holder remains constant regardless of the cantilever topography variation. As shown in the animation, the topography is measured directly using the deflection of the cantilever. While this mode allows high-speed imaging, it can only be used on relatively smooth, strong surfaces. Surfaces that are too soft are often torn because of the higher amounts of force placed on the soft surface. The variable tip-sample interaction force also leads to distortion in the image. It also doesnâ€™t deal well with large height changes of the sample as cantilever can detach from the sample or get bent to significantly that may break the probe."
