	"subtitle":"In Scanning voltage microscopy, a conductive probe is utilized to map the electric potential of the sample surface. While the conductive probe maintains contact with the sample surface and a voltmeter with high input impedance is used measure the electric potential with high spatial resolution. This technique is typically used to image electronic or optoelectronic samples. As shown in the animation, a voltage potential trace is created simultaneously with the topography variation image at each pixel location."
