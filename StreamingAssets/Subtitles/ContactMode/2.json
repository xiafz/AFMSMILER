	"subtitle":"Piezoresponse Force Microscopy is a Contact mode AFM imaging technique that measures topography and piezoelectric materials domains. A conductive AFM probe is utilized to apply a high-frequency alternating current to the sample while the probe scans over the sample in constant height mode. For materials with piezoelectric response, mechanical displacement can be induced with the applied voltage and can be demodulated from the cantilever deflection signal. As shown in the animation, at areas with different piezoelectric coefficients, the piezoresponse force microscopy can identify such domain property differences even though the topography image has no change. Since typical piezoelectric coefficients are relatively small, a lock-in amplifier technique is typically used to demodulate this signal to improve the signal to noise ratio. Researchers are also actively developing a noncontact piezoresponse force microscopy technique."
