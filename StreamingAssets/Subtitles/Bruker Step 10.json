	"subtitle":"Engage Probe with Sample to Start Imaging: Bring the focus of the optical microscope to the sample surface. Bring probe closer to sample manually first with both nobs and stepper motor. Pay attention to the optical microscope view of the probe as it approaches the sample surface. The probe image should initially be blurred and gradually becomes clear as it comes closer to the sample and into the focus of the optical microscope. Switch to software automatic engagement when the probe is sufficiently close to the sample. Imaging will automatically start once engaged."
