	"subtitle":"The multimodal operation module illustrates the scan line formation process for various AFM imaging techniques. Following the classification scheme in the book, the AFM operation modes are categorized based on the cantilever states as contact modes, dynamic modes, jumping modes and hybrid modes. The animation provides a visual illustration about each mode and corresponding voice-over narratives are provided to introduce the general principles."
