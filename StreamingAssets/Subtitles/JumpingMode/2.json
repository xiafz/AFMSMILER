	"subtitle":"Peak Force Quantitative Nanomechanical Property imaging is a derived mode from Peak Force taping mode to image nanomechanical properties in addition to sample topography. These properties include modulus, adhesion, dissipation, and deformation.  As shown in the animation, PFQNM works by analyzing the force distance data that it collects directly to generate the desired property in addition to the sample topography."
