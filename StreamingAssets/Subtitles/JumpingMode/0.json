	"subtitle":"Force Volume Mapping is the most fundamental jumping mode imaging. FVM works by using an AFM probe to image the topography and the tip-sample forces along a defined grid of points. As shown in the animation, FVM acquires force curves at all the different points in the defined grid. It uses these force curves in conjunction with the topographical data to create the relationships between topography and properties. Contact mechanics models can be fitted to the data to estimate nanomechanical properties at various locations of the sample including stiffness, damping, adhesion etc. Compared to contact mode, force volume mode does not have the friction problem. Compared to dynamic modes, the resonance frequency of the cantilever is not excited. Depending on the functionalization of the probe tip, different interaction forces can be imaged with FVM including adhesion, elasticity, stiffness, deformation, viscoelasticity, electrical properties, and chemical binding interactions.  One major limitation of force volume mode is its relatively slow imaging formation speed that can take a long time to form a single image."
