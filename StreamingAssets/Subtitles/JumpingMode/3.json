	"subtitle":"Ringing Mode is an extension of the Peak Force Quantitative Nanomechanical Property mode. It is a sub-resonant mode that enables mapping of surface adhesion properties that were previously impossible with the PFQNM. Ringing Mode provides 8 new quantitative compositional imaging channels which can extend the data available in PFQNM to up to 14 different data types. The new channels are resorted adhesion, adhesion height, zero-force height, disconnection height, pull-off neck size, disconnection distance, disconnection energy loss, and dynamic creep phase shift. As the probe retracts from the sample surface, the sample will originally stick, forming a neck, until it disconnects and only the top layer of residua; surface molecules remain. Once these fall off, the disconnection distance is reached and the cantilever will rapidly jump back and forth as its momentum carries it. All these data are collected at each pixel location for further analysis to extract the desired parameters. The Ringing Mode analyzes the cantilever deflection data to quantitatively obtain these parameters to create images."
