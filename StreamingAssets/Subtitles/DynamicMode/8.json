	"subtitle":"Magnetic Force Microscopy is in principle very similar to Electrostatic Force Microscopy. A magnetized tip is scanned over the sample in non-contact mode to map out the magnetic stray field over the sample as shown in the animation. An interleaved two-pass mode can again be used to separate the contribution of topography and the magnetic field. In principle, the second pass can also be performed by measuring the cantilever static deflection directly but dynamic mode operation with resonance excitation is almost always performed for its higher sensitivity. Due to the relatively complex interaction between the probe tip magnetization and the sample stray magnetic field, MFM is mostly performed as a qualitative mapping instead of quantitative images. Selecting suitable probes corresponding to the desired magnetic field to be imaged is important to ensure a good result."
