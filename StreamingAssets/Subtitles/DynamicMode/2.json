	"subtitle":"Frequency Modulation-AFM works by tracking the change in the resonance frequency of the AFM cantilever. A phase-locked loop is used to track the resonance frequency shift of the cantilever as it interacts with the sample surface. Compared to AM-AFM, the resonance excitation source has a variable driving amplitude and frequency in FM-AFM. The small shift in resonance frequency reflects the force gradient of the tip-sample interaction. The feedback controller keeps the cantilever oscillating at constant amplitude through the driver loop and keeps the resonance frequency shift to track the desired reference by adjusting the relative tip-sample position. FM-AFM helps to increase the imaging speed of tapping mode AFM while the damping coefficient of the cantilever is extremely low, such as in ultra-high vacuum environments, where amplitude or phase modulating techniques can be challenging. As shown in the illustration, the oscillation amplitude remains mostly constant and the frequency changes when encountering a change in topography and will then quickly go back to its setpoint as the controller responds to the topography variation."
