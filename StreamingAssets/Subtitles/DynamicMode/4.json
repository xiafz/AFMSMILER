	"subtitle":"Multifrequency mode is an AFM imaging technique that excites the cantilever at two or more resonance frequencies. The lower frequency resonance can be used for topography imaging while higher resonance frequency can be used to provide material property contrast information. The origin of multi-frequency excitation can come from the tapping piezo, the sample mechanical excitation on the probe tip or electromagnetic force interactions. As shown in the animation, the amplitude and phase of the cantilever at multiple resonance frequencies can be utilized for imaging or contrast mapping."
