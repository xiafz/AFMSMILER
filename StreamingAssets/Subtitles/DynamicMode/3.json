	"subtitle":"Non-contact AFM is also very similar to tapping mode imaging with amplitude modulation. The main difference is that NC AFM operates in the attractive region of the Lennard-Jones potential instead of the repulsive region so that the tip is deemed as not in contact with the sample. NC-AFM requires clear sample substrate without a layer of water meniscus layer, which is ideally achieved in specialized environments such as vacuum. As shown in the animation, the tip-sample interaction force shifts in the attractive region on the Lennard Jones potential curve. To ensure true non-contact imaging, the scan speed should be relatively slow so that the controller can keep up with the topography variation and the tip-sample interaction force does not go into the repulsive region of the Lennard Jones potential."
