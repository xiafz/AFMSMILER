	"subtitle":"Scattering type scanning nearfield optical microscopy is used to boost the spatial resolution of spectroscopy techniques such as Fourier Transformation Infrared Spectroscopy. The scanning technique utilizes the properties of evanescent waves to overcome the optical diffraction limit on the spatial resolution for surface spectroscopic analysis. s-SNOM works by shining a laser at a target wavelength on a metallic probe tip typically coated with gold. The amplitude tapping mode tracks the surface topography and injects a vibrating signature into the near-field scattered light, which allows the near-field signal to be distinguished from the far-field noise. Due to the non-linear interaction of the evanescent waves, using lock-in amplifier to extract scattered light signal at higher harmonics is helpful to improve the signal to noise ratio. As shown in the animation, s-SNOM can operate in single wavelength imaging mode where the absorption and reflection characteristics of a specific wavelength is mapped out. Alternatively, a broad band laser can be used to collect the full absorption spectrum using the FTIR technique, which forms a spectrum hyper-pixel at each location. Compared to the conventional coaxial aperture based SNOM, the scattering technique is much more flexible and easier to use."
