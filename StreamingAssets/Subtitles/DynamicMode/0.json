	"subtitle":"Amplitude Modulation AFM is the most widely used dynamic mode imaging technique. It is also named as tapping mode, intermittent contact mode or dynamic force mode. During imaging, the cantilever resonance is excited at a fixed frequency with a constant driving amplitude. The probe tip makes contact with the sample for very short periods of time which significantly reduce the friction force during tip-sample interaction. This helps avoid damaging fragile samples and keeps the probe tip in good shape for longer imaging time because it doesnâ€™t have to stay in contact and drag along the surface of the sample. In AM-AFM, the amplitude change reflects the tip-sample interaction force directly. A lock-in amplifier is used to extract the oscillation amplitude and the feedback controller regulates the amplitude of the oscillation. The lock-in amplifier can also produce phase information and create material property contrast maps. As shown in the illustration, the amplitude changes when encountering a change in topography and will then quickly go back to its setpoint as the controller responds to the topography variation."
