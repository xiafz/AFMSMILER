	"subtitle":"KPFM is a scanning technique that analyzes at the surface of a sample allowing the contact potential difference (CPD) to be mapped. The CPD is important for figuring out the work function and the surface potential of the sample, where the work function is the energy required to remove an electron from the Fermi level of a solid. KPFM can take place in or out of a vacuum, but most quantitative scans take place in a vacuum environment. KPFM can be conducted with tapping mode operation both in amplitude modulation or frequency modulation. To distinguish between the contribution from topography change and CPD change, the interleaved mode can be used as shown in the animation. The topography information is obtained in the first path using tapping mode AFM. In the second path, the scanner cancels out the sample topography variation in an interleaved mode with an AC electrical potential applied at the resonance frequency of the conductive cantilever. An oscillating electrostatic force between the tip and sample is produced and can be used to measure the CPD between the cantilever and the surface of the sample. As an alternative, multifrequency techniques can be used for a single path of KPFM where the topography variation is captured using the first resonance and the CPD variation is extracted from the second cantilever resonance frequency."
