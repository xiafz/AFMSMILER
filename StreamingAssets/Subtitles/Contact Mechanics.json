	"subtitle":"The contact mechanics module is designed to improve understanding of the microscopic interaction between the AFM probe tip with deformable sample surface. A simplified Hertz model is utilized for a flat sample surface and four tip geometries with dynamic effects and adhesion ignored. Usage of this module is relatively straight forward. First, provide material properties, probe geometry and indentation parameters. Then click the Start button to generate an indentation curve as a single pixel in the force volume mode. In practice, the curve is fitted with the parametric model to estimate the sample material properties such as Youngâ€™s modulus. With presence of complex un-modeled factors such as adhesion, the real approach and retract curve will look differently in an actual AFM indentation curve."
