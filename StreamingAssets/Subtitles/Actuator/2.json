	"subtitle":"Photothermal actuation utilizes a bimorph structure made by bonding two layers of materials with different coefficients of thermal expansion and Young's modulus. It is in principle similar to electrothermal actuation except that a laser is utilized to supply the heating power. A high-efficiency laser power absorption element is added to the cantilever to improve the heat transfer."
