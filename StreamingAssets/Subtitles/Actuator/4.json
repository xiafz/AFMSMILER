	"subtitle":"Electromagnetic actuation is widely utilized in conventional electrical motors and can also be utilized for cantilever actuation. Based on fundamental electromagnetic relations, the force is a cross product of the current and the magnetic field. With an external permanent magnet, this can be achieved by embedding a current loop in the cantilever to control the force with the current. Alternatively, a small permanent magnet can be placed on the cantilever and using external coils to control the general magnetic field that can control both deflection and twisting of the cantilever probe."
