	"subtitle":"Electrothermal actuation is a widely used embedded cantilever actuation method that can both excite resonance and control static deflection. A bimorph structure is made by bonding two layers of materials with different coefficients of thermal expansion and Young's modulus. By heating the structure from ambient temperature using an embedded serpentine shape resistive heater, a linear relationship exists between the deflection and the cantilever temperature."
