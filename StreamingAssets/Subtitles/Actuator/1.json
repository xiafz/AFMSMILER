	"subtitle":"Piezoacoustic actuation is the most widely used AFM cantilever resonance excitation method. By embedding a piezo actuator in the probe holder, the vibration can acoustically propagate to the cantilever to excite the resonance. If the piezo actuator is placed directly at the base support chip of the probe, the static relative position between the probe tip and the sample can be controlled directly."
