	"subtitle":"Tip-Enhanced Raman Spectroscopy is a combined microscopy technique that provides information about the chemical species information of a sample. The TERS make use of the Raman spectroscopy and the inelastic light scattering of photons that have the ability to excite molecules to a higher vibrational state. The shift in energy provides important details about the specific chemical group of the sample. TERS builds upon this principle and uses AFM probe tip to massively increase the effectiveness of the Raman spectroscopy process. In TERS, Noble metal nanoparticles are etched into the tip of a scanning probe, and the tip gets illuminated with electromagnetic radiation. This in turn enhances the relatively weak Raman signal from the molecules on the sample below the probe. As shown in the animation, Raman Spectra can be collected at each pixel location as a hyper pixel."
