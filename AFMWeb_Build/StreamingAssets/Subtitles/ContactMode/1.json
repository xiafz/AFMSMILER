	"subtitle":"Constant Force mode is another version of Contact mode AFM imaging, very similar to the Constant Height mode. The main difference is that a nano-positioner is used to regulate the cantilever deflection to be a constant specified by the user as reference. As shown in the animation, the relative position between the probe and sample changes in response to the topography variation. The bandwidth of the controller and the nano-positioner, which is typically lower than the cantilever resonance frequency, places limits on the maximum achievable scanning speed. Compared to the Constant Height mode, the Constant Force mode maintains a constant tip-sample interaction force that results in less distortion during the scan. It can also handle larger sample topography variations up to the range of the nano-positioner in the vertical direction. However, dealing with soft samples can still be tricky since the friction force between the probe tip and the sample tip may still cause a problem."
