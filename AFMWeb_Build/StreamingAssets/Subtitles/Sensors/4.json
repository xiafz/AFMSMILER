	"subtitle":"Optomechanical deflection sensing method uses a micro disk with optical wave guide. The back end of the cantilever is evanescently coupled to the optical micro disk created with nanofabrication. The relative displacement of the cantilever causes a frequency shift of the optical cavity, which can be measured by a spectrum analyzer."
