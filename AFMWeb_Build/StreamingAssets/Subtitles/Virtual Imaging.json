	"subtitle":"The virtual interaction module is designed to reproduce the AFM imaging process without the need of a physical instrument. Motion visualization of the probe and sample is exaggerated to illustrate the principle. The scanning can be conducted in contact mode with either constant height or constant force and in dynamic tapping mode with amplitude modulation. To run a virtual imaging experiment, use the following steps. 1.Select and load a virtual sample into the software. 2.Select the mode of operation or the imaging experiment. 3.Enter the desired imaging parameters for scan range, pixel resolution and scan rate. 4.Click the Start button and watch the pixels being acquired by the system virtually. To stop the experiment visualization, click the Stop button."
