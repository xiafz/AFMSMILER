	"subtitle":"Piezoelectric actuation utilizes the converse piezoelectric effect to generate strain with applied electric field. A piezoelectric element can be nanofabricated to embed on the microcantilever. The cantilever resonance frequency can be excited by applying a voltage signal across the embedded piezoelectric element. In principle, the cantilever static deflection can also be controlled to some extent but the leakage charge and creep nonlinearity problem makes it less ideal."
