	"subtitle":"Electrostatic actuation utilizes the Coulomb interaction force that becomes significant on the microscopic scale. An electrode is placed in close proximity with the cantilever where both of them are biased with external electrical circuit. Depending on the polarity and level of the voltage, both attractive and repulsive forces can be applied to control the dynamic oscillation and static deflection."
