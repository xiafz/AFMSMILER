	"subtitle":"Contact resonance imaging mode is a hybrid mode combining contact mode and dynamic mode. As shown in the animation, while maintaining the probe tip and the sample in contact, the resonance of the cantilever can be excited. This modulation helps to extract mechanical properties of the sample. As an example, if the electrical excitation frequency to the piezoelectric material is at the cantilever resonance, it can be considered as a contact resonance mode."
