	"subtitle":"The cantilever mechanics module is designed to visualize the deflection, internal stress and strain distribution within a cantilever. Notice that the simulation utilizes the analytical expressions from the Euler-Bernoulli beam bending theory in the linear elastic region derived for a simple uniform cantilever probe in the book. The deflection is exaggerated significantly to better visualize the AFM. The microcantilever probe is at the center of an atomic force microscope, As shown in the 3D model, the probe is composed of a base support chip with 3.4 millimeter by 1.6 millimeter by 0.4 millimeter, a microcantilever beam with hundreds of micrometers in length, tens of micrometers in width and several micrometers in thickness, and a sharp tip several microns in overall height and down to several nanometers in tip sharpness. On the left-hand-side of the simulator, the material elastic modulus, length, width and thickness of the cantilever with a uniform a rectangular cross-sectional area can be adjusted discretely. The applied force at the tip of the AFM cantilever can also be adjusted, which is assumed to be at the free end of the cantilever in the vertical direction. The internal stress within the cross-sectional area of the cantilever is visualized on the right-hand-side of the simulator. The specific location along the length axis of the cross-sectional area visualized can also be adjusted by dragging the area on the beam in the 2D plot. Please play around the input parameters to get a better sense about the mechanics of the AFM microcantilever beam."
