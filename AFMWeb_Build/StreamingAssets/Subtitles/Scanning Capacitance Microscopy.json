	"subtitle":"Scanning Capacitance Microscopy is a contact mode AFM similar to Scanning Spreading Resistance Microscopy. Instead of measuring resistance, this technique uses a sensitive high-frequency resonant circuit to measure the capacitance. As shown in the animation, a capacitance trace is created at each pixel location in addition to the topography. It is very good at imaging the variation in carrier concentration inside semiconductor structures."
