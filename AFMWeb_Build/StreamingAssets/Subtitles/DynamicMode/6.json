	"subtitle":"Electrostatic Force Microscopy is a scanning technique that focuses on the electrostatic force of a sample. It utilizes a dynamic non-contact system of AFM. This technique makes use of the attraction or repulsion of charges between the sample and the cantilever tip to get its readings on the electrostatic force. EFM works by applying a bias voltage between the tip and the sample, which forms a capacitor between the tip and the sample. The electrostatic force can then be found by changing the voltage, which in turn affects the force. Since the electrostatic force interaction between the sample and the probe tip is relatively strong in the long range, its operation is always in the attractive region of the Lennard-Jones potential. To remove the contribution from topography variation, an interleaved two-pass scan mode can be used where the scanned topography is compensated by the scanner during the second path to isolate the electrostatic force information. As shown in the animation, an electrostatic force trace is obtained simultaneously with the topography trace."
